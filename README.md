OpenStack Builder
=================

Creates an OpenStack test environment using Ansible, following the steps in the [Openstack Docs](http://docs.openstack.org/juno/install-guide/install/apt/content/).  Creating on Vagrant, but the Ansible playbooks are meant to be used for installing OpenStack in the LA lab.

This is a work-in-progress and is being done so that I can learn a bit about OpenStack.  Yes, there are better examples out there.
